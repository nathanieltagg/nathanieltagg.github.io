<div id='description'>

<p>I am an experimental particle physicist, used to working in teams and with large collaborations. I use software to simulate, calibrate, control, and acquire data from hardware (such as massive, complex particle detectors).  I am expert with data analysis, data acquisition, databases, and visualization. I have created everything from hardware interfaces to web applications, both close-to-the-metal resource-intense computing and high-level GUIs. I am adept at mastering new systems and technologies.  I am an expert teacher and presenter and I excel at engaging all kinds of audiences.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<h2>Job History</h2>

<h3>Professor, Otterbein University - 2008-2021  </h3>
<p>Teaching, research, and service to the university and scientific communities.  Developed courses and curricula. Created educational simulations to illustrate electric fields and wave propagation for undergraduates. Invented a full-stack database tools to aid faculty in advising students.  Awarded continuous NSF research funding for 15 years, directly supporting work on the large international MINERvA, MicroBooNE and DUNE experiments.  Notable contributions included creation of 2- and 3-D interactive event display software, creation, development and maintenance of highly-parallel near-time detector monitoring, contributions to event reconstruction and core software support, and public outreach.</p>
<p>Promoted to Full Professor two years early.</p>

<h3>Chair of Physics, Otterbein University - 2016-2020</h3>
<p>Responsible for personnel, budget, and assessment/review.</p>

<h3>Visiting Professor, Tufts University - 2006-2008<br>
Research assistant, Brookhaven National Lab - 2007-2008</h3>
<p>Research on the MINOS and Daya Bay experiments. Notable projects include measurement of the time-of-flight of neutrinos over 450 miles, development of monte-carlo simulations, leader of scientific task force for detector calibration, and authorship of software for managing detector calibration databases.</p>

<h3>Postdoctoral Research Assistant, Oxford University (UK) - 2000-2006</h3>
<p>Responsible for system used to establish nanosecond time synchronization, development of an optical Monte-Carlo simulation of scintillator for the MINOS collaboration.</p>
